Task 2.1:
I used Extract Method to move the pricing switch into getAmount(Performance).
I renamed variables to improve clarity (result → statementText, p → performance).

Task 2.2:
I used Extract Method to move volume credit logic into getVolumeCredits(Performance).
This simplified the statement() loop and centralized credit rules.

Task 2.3:
I removed the local formatting variable and instead format inside the output expression.
This reduced temporary state and made statement() more concise.

Task 2.4:
I removed the temporary totalAmount and volumeCredits from the loop and now rely on helper methods.
This completed separation of formatting from calculation and improved cohesion.
